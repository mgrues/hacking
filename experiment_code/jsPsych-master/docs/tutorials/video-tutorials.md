# Video tutorials

A variety of video tutorials are available on [Josh de Leeuw's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnfo1lBY1P2Mf_o6rV5wiqqn92Mw3UTGh). Some tutorials walk through creating a basic version of an entire experiment, like the tutorial on creating a [dichotic listening experiment](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnfo1lBY1P2Mf_o6rV5wiqqn92Mw3UTGh) aimed at new users. Others focus on specific features of jsPsych, like how to use [functions as parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-j2aAZ_iOk&list=PLnfo1lBY1P2Mf_o6rV5wiqqn92Mw3UTGh&index=5) to create experiments that change in response to participant input or how to [create a new plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQcsFwAmbiw&list=PLnfo1lBY1P2Mf_o6rV5wiqqn92Mw3UTGh&index=4).

Recordings from a Summer 2020 workshop on conducting online research with jsPsych are available on the [workshop's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBZ5F1UysHWlplUNDRwbsWA). [Session 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuhfsIFRFe8) provides an overview of jsPsych suitable for brand new users.
